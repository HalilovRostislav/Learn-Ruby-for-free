# What is Cycle?

A looping algorithm is an algorithm in which a set of instructions is repeated a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

In cyclic algorithms, one can distinguish the following
mandatory components:

* condition
* loop body
* counter

Depending on where the condition is (up to the body
cycle or after), cycles can be divided into cycles

with a postcondition and loops with a precondition.
