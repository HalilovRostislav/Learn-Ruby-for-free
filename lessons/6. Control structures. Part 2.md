# What is Cycle?

A looping algorithm is an algorithm in which a set of instructions is repeated a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

In cyclic algorithms, one can distinguish the following
mandatory components:

* condition
* loop body
* counter

Depending on where the condition is (up to the body
cycle or after), cycles can be divided into cycles

with a postcondition and loops with a precondition.

While loop: the body of the loop is executed
while a certain condition
evaluates to true.

If, as a condition for this cycle, we set
parameter - true, the loop will be infinite
(run an infinite number of times).

Output:

Hello, world!

Hello, world!

Hello, world!

Hello, world!


A while loop’s conditional is separated from code by the reserved word do, a newline, backslash, or a semicolon.
