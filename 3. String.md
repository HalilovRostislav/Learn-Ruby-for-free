# What we known about String?
          
A string is a sequence of one or more characters, which can consist of letters, numbers, and other characters. 
In Ruby, strings are objects and, unlike other languages, strings are mutable â€” they can be edited without having to create a new string.


# Ways to create a string:
+ a = 'Hello World!'
+ a = "Hello World!"
The string can be enclosed in single and double quotes
