# Algorithm concept

An algorithm is a set of instructions describing the order of the executor's actions.
to achieve the result you want.

Algorithms are divided into:

* Linear algorithms are algorithms in which a set of instructions
is performed strictly in order and once.

* Branching algorithms are algorithms that have at least one operator
branching, after the execution of which the next
sequence of instructions to execute.

# What are conditional constructs?

Conditional construct is basic
a construct that contains conditions, and
on the progress of this condition and
the subsequent work of all
designs (performance of certain
instructions).

Such structures include structures:
if, if-else, if-else-if, if-elsif, case, unless, and ternary operator.

The most common condition is the if condition.

The code between the if-end keywords is executed only if the expression
condition evaluates to true.

in this case, if 2 + 2 == 4 ("==" is an equal sign) then "it's true" will be displayed
