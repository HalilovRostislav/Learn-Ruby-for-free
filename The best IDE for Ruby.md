# What is IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is not just a text editor. 
While text editors for code like Sublime or Atom offer many handy features like syntax highlighting, 
customizable interface, and advanced navigation, they only allow you to write code. At the very least, 
you need a compiler and a debugger to create functional applications.


IDE - includes these components, 
like a number of others. Some of them come with additional tools to automate,
test and visualize the development process. The term "integrated development environment" 
means that everything you need to turn your code into functioning applications is provided.
