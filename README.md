# Learn-Ruby-for-free
Hello everyone, my name is Rostislav. I haven't edited this repository for a long time. I am not a professional Ruby programmer. I wrote this repository when I was interested in the Ruby language. So don't judge too harshly :). If you are already an experienced Ruby programmer, you may find bugs and bugs.
If you find a bug or want to help me, please email me: halrost2008@gmail.com
I wish you all a good mood!
